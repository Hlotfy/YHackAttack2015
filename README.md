Problem 

According to U.S census  bureau , about 38.5% of the population did not vote in the United States.
On the citizen population 41.9% voted and on the registered population 64.9%
A lot of eligible people between the age of 18 and 34 do not vote .

Possible reasons 
Some do not know how politics work in the United States.
Some donâ€™t know which politicians matches more their opinions.
Some donâ€™t know how to access trustworthy and non-biased information or they are just lazy.
Some donâ€™t know they can actually make a difference or donâ€™t know where to start.
And then there are those that just donâ€™t care or donâ€™t know how something can affect them.

Approach
The new generation is a generation that now runs and relies on technology for about anything ! Whether
itâ€™s to replace teachers (wink wink), get random news , stay in contact with others and other things , 
through various mediums , technology has allowed people to access a lot more information faster.
We tried to use that accessibility and apply it to political information 

Solution : 
iCare?

What we want 
Impact --> provide a tool to inform raise awareness on various issues of 			society 
In the Full app we want to make :
--> a section that explains how the voting system works in the united states (who elects the president 
of the United States ? , how the president and the vice president are elected? What is voter turnout in 
the United States? How does the electoral college choose the president and vice president? )
--> a section that helps you get in contact with political parties 
--> a section that notifies you on news concerning whatever interest you may have (new bills , congressman 
changing opinions)
